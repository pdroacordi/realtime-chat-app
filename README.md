## üöÄ About the project

This project is an _erudio_ project to learn about WebSockets and their potential for real-time interaction.

In its current version, it has no security, database, or concern for its aesthetics whatsoever, as I made it with the single intention of understanding the capabilities of WebSockets. However, I aim to implement a database and peer-to-peer cryptography later.

PS: This project has been abandoned. If you seek for a better version of it, take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/pdroacordi/whatsapp-clone)
